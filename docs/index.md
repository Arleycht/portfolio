# About Me

I'm a programmer with the exceedingly great ability to ~~get distracted by useless side projects~~ learn things that would not be conventionally known to be a part of one curriculum. I like to write maintainable, readable, and modular code (optimize when necessary).

Everything I can do is self taught, and everything I know is second hand knowledge.

My ability and curiosity to learn is my strongest trait. I have taught myself nearly everything I know, and everything else is second hand knowledge from anecdotal stories and lessons given by people who know more than me. While I'm not quite skilled at many of the things I do as a hobby, such as drawing or music, I know a lot about software architecture, game design, and definitely other things I can't attach a name to right now because I'm not being paid to do so.

I often critique, usually to myself, about why decisions are made and try to reason about everything as if I was the creator, which goes for even things that aren't software. This is also why I find myself getting distracted when I'm doing things for fun, because I want to learn more about _everything_.

# Past Projects

## Capstone Project

My capstone team produced a simple third person boss fighting shooter. We were told not to focus on graphics, but I think we took that a bit to the extreme by barely doing art at all...

## Minecraft DanSMP Plugin

*The clip above doesn't showcase my plugin's features, but it's one of the moments that I liked.*

The [DanSMP project](https://github.com/Arleycht/DanSMP-Plugin) was a near solid consecutive 3 months of nonstop feedback, development, and seeing everyone have fun. This was a great learning experience and I'm planning on doing a post-mortem analysis of what caused the overall server experience to fail, what I would've done differently, and what I specifically really enjoyed.

## Drawing Tablet Stand

![[images/tablet_stand_2.jpg]] ![[images/tablet_stand_1.jpg]]

I designed a simple tablet stand that can be disassembled, because I didn't like any of the cheap options and the ones I did were too expensive. It was supposed to be adjustable between three angles, but it turns out that after changing the size of the supporting foot (the other design snapped off and I glued it back together), it caused interference issues with the shallowest angle. In the end, I only use the one angle shown in the picture and sometimes the built-in legs of the tablet.
