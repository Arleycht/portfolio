I like to write maintainable, readable, and modular code (optimize when necessary).</p> <p>Everything I can do is self taught, and everything I know is second hand knowledge.</p> <p>My ability and curiosity to learn is my strongest trait. I have taught myself nearly everything I know, and everything else is second hand knowledge from anecdotal stories and lessons given by people who know more than me. While I'm not quite skilled at many of the things I do as a hobby, such as drawing or music, I know a lot about software architecture, game design, and definitely other things I can't attach a name to right now because I'm not being paid to do so.</p> <p>I often critique, usually to myself, about why decisions are made and try to reason about everything as if I was the creator, which goes for even things that aren't software. This is also why I find myself getting distracted when I'm doing things for fun, because I want to learn more about everything.</p>"},{"location":"#tools-i-use","title":"Tools I Use","text":"<ul> <li>Software<ul> <li>Programming<ul> <li>IntelliJ IDEA</li> <li>Git/GitHub</li> <li>Notepad++</li> <li>Visual Studio Code</li> <li>Visual Studio</li> </ul> </li> <li>Languages<ul> <li>C</li> <li>C++</li> <li>C#</li> <li>Java</li> <li>Javascript</li> <li>Kotlin<sup>1</sup></li> <li>Lua</li> <li>Python</li> <li>Rust<sup>1</sup></li> <li>TypeScript<sup>1</sup></li> </ul> </li> <li>Modeling<ul> <li>Blender</li> <li>Fusion 360</li> <li>OpenSCAD</li> </ul> </li> <li>Game Engines<ul> <li>Godot</li> <li>Roblox</li> <li>Unity</li> </ul> </li> <li>Images<ul> <li>Clip Studio Paint</li> <li>ExifTool</li> <li>GIMP</li> <li>Krita</li> <li>Paint.NET</li> </ul> </li> <li>Audio<ul> <li>Audacity</li> <li>MuseScore</li> </ul> </li> <li>Video<ul> <li>DaVinci Resolve</li> <li>FFMPEG</li> <li>OBS</li> <li>VLC</li> </ul> </li> <li>Misc<ul> <li>Obsidian</li> <li>KeePassXC</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#past-projects","title":"Past Projects","text":""},{"location":"#capstone-project","title":"Capstone Project","text":"<p>My capstone team produced a simple third person boss fighting shooter.

It was supposed to be adjustable between three angles, but it turns out that after changing the size of the supporting foot (the other design snapped off and I glued it back together), it caused interference issues with the shallowest angle. In the end, I only use the one angle shown in the picture and sometimes the built-in legs of the tablet.</p> <ol> <li> <p>I am still learning these things\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"PGP/","title":"PGP","text":"<p>-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----</p> <p>mDMEZT7Q0BYJKwYBBAHaRw8BAQdA/6qaLL4nqrB4C3UXh6Ie3mUznzcp6HOaKHfw YRqSaQi0HUFybGV5Y2h0IDxhcmxleWNodEBwcm90b24ubWU+iJkEExYKAEECGwMF CwkIBwICIgIGFQoJCAsCBBYCAwECHgcCF4AWIQQliCqsiKxye6rJw8POOQLNcdUg agUCZT93kgUJBaaWswAKCRDOOQLNcdUgas+7AQDRMwfnSpHD/B5wS9BHvDUmTeMS sKaxEBo3rrM7eIc5RwD+L5UA0fgtpytLaZcbCoFJ8F0+eBXKNvwFAF3W4OGGFwW4 OARlPtDQEgorBgEEAZdVAQUBAQdAN6d29SU2l/p7PJG3RCQy0Wi3+hGP7CcKn203 AcQzNAsDAQgHiH4EGBYKACYCGwwWIQQliCqsiKxye6rJw8POOQLNcdUgagUCZT93 kgUJBaaWswAKCRDOOQLNcdUgakS4AQChZ70tnzCw3auHRsFGDV8XDjZiLqOFhiip lGfUECLXkAD/QL1RwBIRHg2LYqJIEcYKeW/PJfcAcRlLOHq1TS6sPww= =HwrP -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----</p>"},{"location":"Creations/Blender%20Creations/","title":"Punishing Bird","text":""},{"location":"Creations/Blender%20Creations/#fish","title":"Fish","text":""}]}
